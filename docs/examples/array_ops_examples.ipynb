However, we want to fit these models using all of the trials' data, and then take the 2-dimensional data and split it back into the same trial lengths. To quickly do this, we can use the ```concat_apply``` function in naplib, which concatenates data across trials, performs some function on it, and then returns the result as a list of trials once again."
