Overview of naplib_
===================

.. _naplib: https://github.com/naplab/naplib-python

Motivation
----------

naplib-python aims to facilitate the easy processing and analysis of neural-acoustic data - i.e. neural recordings collected from sensory systems in response to auditory stimuli. The collection of algorithms and methods in the package can be used with a wide variety of data modalities, enabling the easy transfer of methods and code between researchers in the field of auditory neuroscience.

Highlighted examples to get started
-----------------------------------

The following examples can give you a sense of how to get started with naplib-python for analyzing neural-acoustic data.

- `Importing data <examples/import_bids_data.html>`_:
    Getting started with naplib-python by importing data from BIDS format.

- `Fitting STRF models <examples/STRF_fitting_basics.html>`_:
    Fitting and evaluating spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF) models of auditory cortex.

- `Performing phoneme and word alignment <examples/phoneme_and_word_alignment.html>`_:
    Aligning text to speech stimuli using the built-in forced aligner.

Python
------

Python is a powerful programming language that allows concise expressions of network
algorithms.  Python has a vibrant and growing ecosystem of packages that
mvlearn uses to provide more features such as numerical linear algebra. In order to make the most out of mvlearn you will want to know how
to write basic programs in Python.  Among the many guides to Python, we
recommend the `Python documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/>`_.
