Overview of naplib_
===================

.. _naplib: https://github.com/naplab/naplib-python

Motivation
----------

naplib-python aims to facilitate the easy processing and analysis of neural-acoustic data - i.e. neural recordings collected from sensory systems in response to auditory stimuli. The collection of algorithms and methods in the package can be used with a wide variety of data modalities, enabling the easy transfer of methods and code between researchers in the field of auditory neuroscience.

Highlighted examples to get started
-----------------------------------

The following examples can give you a sense of how to get started with naplib-python for analyzing neural-acoustic data. More examples and tutorial notebooks can be found in the `Examples gallery <auto_examples/index.html>`_.

- `Importing data from BIDS <auto_examples/data_manipulation_preprocessing/plot_import_bids_data.html>`_:
    Getting started with naplib-python by importing data from BIDS format.

- `Preprocessing neural data <auto_examples/data_manipulation_preprocessing/plot_preprocessing_examples.html>`_:
    Preprocessing neural data, including electrode selection and frequency band extraction.

- `Fitting STRF models <auto_examples/strf_fitting/plot_STRF_fitting_basics.html>`_:
    Fitting and evaluating spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF) models of auditory cortex.

Python
------

Python is a powerful programming language that allows concise expressions of network
algorithms.  Python has a vibrant and growing ecosystem of packages that
naplib-python uses to provide more features such as numerical linear algebra. In order to use all the capabilities of naplib-python, you will want to know how
to write basic programs in Python.  Among the many guides to Python, we
recommend the `Python documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/>`_.
